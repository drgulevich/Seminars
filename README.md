# Many-Body Seminars @ ITMO

_Date_: Tue 10 September 2019, 13:30 <br/>
_Location_: Birzhevaya liniya 14, room 301/5 <br/>
_Title_: **Correlated Many-Body Quantum Dynamics in Nonmagnetic and Magnetic Semiconductors** <br/>
_Presenter_: Michael Cosacchi, University of Bayreuth, Germany <br/>
_Abstract_: The dynamics of many-body quantum states in semiconductors is a rich field, both from a theoretical and experimental point of view. Applications range from novel metrology over memristic devices to quantum computing, quantum telecommunication, and quantum cryptography. On ultrashort time scales of a few picoseconds, the collective many-body physics of the system can induce significant correlations. The time scale of these non-Markovian memory effects can be on the same order as the dynamics of the subsystem of interest. Then, advanced theoretical methods are necessary to handle these types of problems. In this talk, an introduction to two different schemes is given: 1. The Path Integral Formalism using Augmented Density Matrices, and 2. Correlation Expansions and Dynamics Controlled Truncation for Infinite Hierarchies. While the first finds an application in the numerically exact treatment of the coupling of a quantum dot exciton to infinitely many modes of longitudinal acoustic phonons, the latter is applied to the exciton spin dynamics in diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum wells.
